# TreapPriorityTransformations
Analyzing how priority transformations affect the shape and operation speeds of treaps

To run the code you need to know     
n - the number of nodes to insert into the treap 
v - the maximum value a node can have
p - the maximum priority a node can have
d - the number of nodes to delete from the treap
s - the number of searches to perform

Then, navigate to this code and run 'python generate_files.py'
Then, enter n, v, p, d, and s in that order into the prompts
This will generate 3 input files

Then, run 'python treap.py' 
This will generate multiple output files. 

Then, you can choose to run 'python checkOutput.py' or run the R script
